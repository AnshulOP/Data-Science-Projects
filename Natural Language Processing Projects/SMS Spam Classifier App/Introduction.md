                                              SMS Spam Classifier App
## Introduction
Welcome to the SMS Spam Classifier App project! This application leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify and filter spam messages from legitimate SMS communications. By combining advanced machine learning algorithms with NLP, this project aims to provide an efficient and accurate solution for spam detection, enhancing user experience and security.

## Project Overview
The SMS Spam Classifier App is designed to automatically classify incoming text messages as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). This classification helps in filtering out unwanted messages, thereby protecting users from potential scams, phishing attempts, and other malicious activities commonly associated with spam.

## Key Features
1. Accurate Spam Detection: Utilizes state-of-the-art NLP techniques to ensure high accuracy in identifying spam messages.
2. Real-time Processing: Capable of classifying messages in real-time, providing instant feedback to users.
3. User-friendly Interface: Intuitive design ensuring ease of use for all users.
4. Scalable Architecture: Designed to handle a large volume of messages, suitable for both individual and enterprise-level deployment.
5. Customizable Filtering: Users can adjust sensitivity and add custom keywords to enhance spam detection.

## Technologies Used
1. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization to preprocess text data.
2. Machine Learning: Algorithms like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest for classification tasks.
3. Python: Primary programming language used for development.
4. Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for implementing classification models.
5. NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): Library for text processing and feature extraction.
6. Flask: Lightweight web framework to deploy the application.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the widely-known SMS Spam Collection dataset, which consists of a set of SMS messages in English, tagged as either spam or ham. This dataset is instrumental in training and testing the classification models.
