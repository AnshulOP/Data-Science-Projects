# Machine Learning Projects
This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects that I have worked on. Each project demonstrates a different machine learning technique and showcases my skills in data preprocessing, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation. The projects are organized into separate folders, with each folder containing the code and data for a specific project.
